# MacViki
A simple macOS webview wrapper around viki.com to add conveniences for watching Viki on your desktop.

Note:
This project is based on danneu/Macflix.app and was reworked to use with Viki.

## Features
-   Fullscreen mode.
-   Remove Pause Overlay.
-   Always on top. The window never leaves your sight.
-   Adjusts to each show's aspect ratio.
-   Drag anywhere to move the window.
-   Ghost mode. The window turns transparent on hover to stay out of your way.

## Releases
There are NO pre-build releases! 
The maintainer has no paid Apple Developer Account (99USD per year) to be allowed to use the Apple certificates so that the application would run flawlessly on your Mac.
If interested, download Xcode (last time tested with version 16.2) from the AppStore and clone the project on your disk and compile it yourself for private use on your own Mac.
