# Macviki

A simple macOS webview wrapper around viki.com to add conveniences for watching Viki on desktop.

Note:
This project is based on danneu/Macflix.app and was reworked to use with Viki.

## Features

-   Fullscreen mode.
-   Remove Pause Overlay.
-   Always on top. The window never leaves your sight.
-   Adjusts to each show's aspect ratio.
-   Drag anywhere to move the window.
-   Ghost mode. The window turns transparent on hover to stay out of your way.

## Releases
There are NO pre-build releases! 
I have no paid Apple Developer Account (99USD per year) to be allowed to use the Apple certificates that it will run on your Mac.
Download Xcode (last time I used version 15.4) from AppStore and clone the project and compile it yourself for private use on your Mac.
