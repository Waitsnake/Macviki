# Macviki

A simple macOS webview wrapper around viki.com to add conveniences for watching Viki on desktop.

## Features

-   Always on top. The window never leaves your sight.
-   Adjusts to each show's aspect ratio.
-   Drag anywhere to move the window.
-   Ghost mode. The window turns transparent on hover to stay out of your way.

### Ghost mode

If Macviki is getting in your way while watching a show, ghost mode will let you see through and click through the window during hover.

`View -> Hide on hover`

## Why

Mainly to practice macOS development.

I like to practice Spanish by putting on a Spanish-language Viki show as I otherwise relax on the computer. I wanted a tiny picture-in-picture solution so that I could idly participate while multi-tasking.

It's also an exploration into how hard it is to drive the Viki UI externally.

Note:
This project is a clone from danneu/Macflix.app that was changed to use with Viki.
